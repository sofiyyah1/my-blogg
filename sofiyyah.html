		<h3>SENSES</h3>
		<p>Generally,cats has 4 sense which are :smell, taste, whiskers and sight. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>SMELL</li>
			<p>cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, which is about twice that of humans. Cats and many other animals have a "jacobson's organ" in their mouth that is used in the behavioural process of FLEHMENING. It allows them to sense some certain aromas in a wat that humans cannot.</p>
			<li>TASTE</li>
			<p>Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans. Domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness.</p>
			<li>WHISKERS</li>

					<p> To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozen of movable whiskers over their body, especially their faces. These provide information on the width of gaps and on location of objects in the dark</p>
			   </div>
			</div>
			<li>SIGHT</li>
			<p>Cats have excellent night vision and can see at one-sixth the light level required for human vision.this is partly a result of cat eyes having a <em>tapetum lucidum,</em> which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye sensivity to dim light.</p>

   		 	<p>Cats are common pets throughout the world. Cats have been used for millenia to control rodents, notably around grain stores and aboard ships, and both uses extend to the present day. Cats are usedin the international fur trade and leather industries for making coats.</p>

 <div id="disease">
 	<h3>CAT DISEASES</h3>
 	<p>About 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats; many are similar to human inborn errors  of metabolism. The high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans as well as use of cats as animal models in the study of human disease.</p>
